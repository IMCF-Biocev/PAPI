## PAPI - **P**ython for **A**nalysis and **P**rocessing of **I**mages

### About the course

This course is structured in two parts:

**Introductory Session:** 
For absolute beginners in Python programming. Participants will start with Python installation and basic syntax, progressing to practical exercises focused on working with digital images and relevant libraries for I/O, measurements, ploting and more. Batch processing of multiple images and an intro to Napari (a Python-based interactive image visualization tool) will also be covered.

**Advanced Session:** 
This session offers extended hands-on practice, more complex image analysis cases, alternative approaches, and the use of AI tools such as Cellpose for segmentation. This session builds on Python skills from the first session. It is ideal for those who completed the introductory session, but also open to participants with basic Python experience. The ability to set up and run a working Python environment is a prerequisite.
